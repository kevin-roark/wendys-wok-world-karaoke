[00:03.63]Right about now, NWA court is in full effect
[00:07.05]Judge Dre residing in the case of NWA v.s. the police department
[00:12.18]Prosecuting attourneys are MC Ren, Ice Cube, and Eazy motherfucking E
[00:18.55]Order, order, order, Ice Cube take the motherfucking stand
[00:22.08]Do you swear to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing, but the truth so help your black ass?
[00:25.85]You god-damn right!
[00:27.25]Well, won't you tell everybody what the fuck you gotta say?
[00:30.99]Fuck the police coming straight from the underground
[00:33.50]A young nigga got it bad 'cause I'm brown
[00:35.95]And not the other color, so police think they have the authority to kill a minority
[00:40.95]Fuck that shit, 'cause I ain't the one
[00:42.71]For a punk motherfucker with a badge and a gun
[00:45.03]To be beating on, and thrown in jail
[00:47.46]We can go toe-to-toe in the middle of a cell
[00:50.25]Fucking with me 'cause I'm a teenager
[00:52.85]With a little bit of gold and a pager
[00:55.10]Searching my car, looking for the prod-a
[00:57.47]Thinkin' every nigga is sellin' narc-da'
[01:00.40]You'd rather see me in the pen'
[01:02.29]Than me and Lorenzo rolling in a Benz-o
[01:05.36]Beat a police outta shape, and when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape
[01:09.69]To tape off the scene of the slaughter
[01:12.27]Still getting swole off bread and water
[01:14.62]I don't know if they fag's, or what?
[01:17.03]Search a nigga down and grabbing his nuts
[01:19.27]And on the other hand, without a gun, they can't get none
[01:22.07]But don't let it be a black and a white one
[01:24.54]'Cause they'll slam ya down to the street top
[01:26.77]Black police showing out for the white cop
[01:29.41]Ice Cube will swarm on any motherfucker in a blue uniform
[01:34.26]Just 'cause I'm from the CPT, punk police are afraid of me, huh
[01:39.29]A young nigga on a warpath, and when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath
[01:43.96]Of cops, dyin' in L.A., yo Dre, I got somethin' to say
[01:48.76]Fuck the police, fuck-, fuck-
[01:51.14]Fuck the police, fuck-, fuck-
[01:53.44]Fuck the police, fuck the-, fuck the-
[01:56.00]Fuck the police (example of scene one)
[01:59.19]Pull your goddamn ass over right now
[02:01.64]Aw shit, now what the fuck you pullin' me over for?
[02:04.70]'Cause I feel like it, just sit your ass on the curb and shut the fuck up
[02:08.34]Man, fuck this shit
[02:09.79]Alright, smart-ass, I'm taking your black-ass to jail
[02:13.22]MC Ren, will you please give your testimony to the jury about this fucked up incident?
[02:17.66]Fuck the police and Ren said it with authority
[02:20.06]Because the niggas on the street is a majority
[02:22.77]A gang, is with whoever I'm steppin'
[02:25.22]And the motherfuckin' weapon is kept in
[02:27.76]A stash spot, for the so-called law
[02:29.93]Wishing Ren was a nigga that they never saw
[02:32.32]Lights start flashing behind me
[02:34.55]But they're scared of a nigga, so they mace me to blind me
[02:37.51]But that shit don't work, I just laugh
[02:40.11]Because it gives 'em a hint not to step in my path
[02:42.32]For police, I'm saying, "Fuck you, punk"
[02:44.73]Reading my rights and shit, it's all junk
[02:47.13]Pulling out a silly club, so you stand
[02:49.39]With a fake-ass badge and a gun in your hand
[02:52.08]But take off the gun so you can see what's up
[02:54.58]And we'll go at it, punk, I'ma fuck you up
[02:56.96]Make ya think I'ma kick your ass
[02:59.11]But drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast
[03:01.53]I'm sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime
[03:04.25]But I'ma smoke 'em now, and not next time
[03:06.76]Smoke any motherfucker that sweats me
[03:09.10]Any asshole that threatens me
[03:11.48]I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope
[03:13.60]Taking out a cop or two, they can't cope with me
[03:16.69]The motherfucking villain that's mad with potential to get bad as fuck
[03:21.37]So I'ma turn it around
[03:23.14]Put in my clip, yo, and this is the sound
[03:26.10]Yeah, something like that, but it all depends on the size of the gat
[03:30.59]Takin' out a police would make my day
[03:33.04]But a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck to say
[03:35.30]Fuck the police, fuck-, fuck-
[03:37.96]Fuck the police, fuck-, fuck-
[03:40.49]Fuck the police, fuck the-, fuck the-
[03:42.97]Fuck the police
[03:45.29]Yeah, man, what you need?
[03:46.54]Police, open now (aww, shit), we have a warrant for Eazy-E's arrest
[03:49.90]Get down and put your hands right where I can see 'em!
[03:51.62]Man, what the fuck did I do? Man, what did I do?
[03:53.90]Just shut the fuck up and get your motherfucking ass on the floor!
[03:57.21]But I didn't even do shit (man, just shut the fuck up!)
[04:00.03]Eazy-E, won't you step up to the stand and tell the jury how you feel about this bullshit?
[04:04.91]I'm tired of the motherfucking jacking
[04:07.33]Sweating my gang while I'm chilling in the shack, and
[04:09.76]Shining the light in my face, and for what?
[04:12.21]Maybe, it's because I kick so much butt
[04:14.13]I kick ass, or maybe 'cause I blast
[04:16.62]On a stupid ass nigga when I'm playing with the trigger
[04:19.36]Of any Uzi or an AK
[04:21.53]'Cause the police always got something stupid to say
[04:24.36]They put up my picture with silence
[04:26.41]'Cause my identity by itself causes violence
[04:29.19]The E with the criminal behavior
[04:31.16]Yeah, I'm a gangster, but still, I got flavor
[04:34.19]Without a gun and a badge, what do ya got?
[04:36.19]A sucka in a uniform waiting to get shot
[04:38.66]By me, or another nigga
[04:41.14]And with a gat, it don't matter if he's smarter or bigger
[04:43.84](Size don't mean shit, he's from the old school, fool)
[04:46.35]And as you all know, E's here to rule
[04:48.55]Whenever I'm rolling, keep looking in the mirror
[04:51.18]And ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a
[04:53.65]Dumb motherfucker with a gun
[04:55.52]And if I'm rolling off the eight, he'll be the one
[04:57.97]That I take out, and then get away
[05:00.73]While I'm driving off laughing, this is what I'll say
[05:03.32]Fuck the police, fuck the-, fuck the-
[05:06.04]Fuck the police, fuck-
[05:08.16]Fuck the police, fuck-fuck-
[05:10.68]Fuck the police (the verdict)
[05:13.70]The jury has found you guilty of being a redneck, whitebread, chicken shit motherfucker
[05:17.98]But wait, that's a lie! That's a god-damn lie!
[05:22.02]Get him out of here (I want justice!)
[05:23.73]Get him the fuck out my face (I want justice!)
[05:25.88]Out, right now!
[05:27.28](Fuck you, you black motherfuckers!)
[05:32.70]Fuck the police
[05:37.50]Fuck the police
[05:42.46]Fuck the police
[05:43.74]
